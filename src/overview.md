# Overview

Welcome to "Getting Started with Python in OpenRefine"!

## Who is this for?

If you are reasonably comfortable using [OpenRefine][] to clean and enhance messy data,
and want either:
1. to perform more complex data transformations than are possible (or at least easily expressed) in GREL; or
2. to continue your learning journey by becoming more familiar with Python...
...then this book is for you.

[OpenRefine]: https://openrefine.org/

It is particularly aimed at those working in
the Galleries, Libraries, Archives & Museums (GLAM) sector,
and many of the examples we will use draw on that background,
but that doesn't mean that 

## What will I learn?

We hope
