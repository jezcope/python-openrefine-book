# Introduction

This book is for you
if you are reasonably comfortable using [OpenRefine][] to clean and enhance messy data,
and want either:
1. to perform more complex data transformations than are possible (or at least easily expressed) in GREL; or
2. to continue their learning journey by becoming more familiar with Python.
